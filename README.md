# Scroll-Progress-Bar

As you scroll down the page, the width of the bar (td-srp-bar-fill) will increase as the scroll position increases, providing a visual indicator of scroll progress.

In order for the bar (td-srp-bar-fill) to grow as you scroll down the page, you need to implement a scroll event that adjusts the width of the bar based on the scroll position of the page. Below is an example of how this can be done using JavaScript and jQuery with HTML and CSS.

Please note: I only saw this idea on a news site (https://averdade.org.br/) and decided to provide the script for the tool because I found it interesting. All credits for the tool are reserved for the team that developed it on their site.
